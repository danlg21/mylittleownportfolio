            She Blossoms is an ecommerce platform designed to support and empower women entrepreneurs. 
            The platform was developed using a modern tech stack, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React for the frontend, 
            and Bootstrap was used to create responsive, user-friendly interfaces.

The platform allows users to create and manage their own stores, list products, and track inventory. We also implemented user 
authentication and role management systems to ensure a secure and personalized experience. Throughout the development process, 
we followed the SCRUM methodology, ensuring iterative progress and adaptability to user feedback.

            The backend of the She Blossoms ecommerce project was developed using Java and the Spring Boot framework to create 
            RESTful APIs. We utilized MySQL as the database for efficient data storage and management, while Hibernate was implemented 
            for object-relational mapping (ORM) between the database and Java objects. For user authentication and authorization, 
            JWT (JSON Web Tokens) was used to ensure secure access. 
            The project used Git for version control, with GitHub as the repository platform.

          <p class="project-description" style="text-align: justify;">
            The database design for the She Blossoms ecommerce project was implemented using MySQL. 
            The schema includes multiple tables for managing users, products, orders, and categories. 
            Users are classified into roles such as buyers and sellers, with each seller associated with a store that 
            can have various products. Products are organized into different categories, and each product has attributes such 
            as price, stock quantity, and description. Relationships between tables are managed using foreign keys to ensure data integrity. 
            Indexes were added to optimize query performance, and MySQL’s relational model was leveraged to enforce structured and normalized 
            data storage.
